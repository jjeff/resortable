# Sortable.js Rewrite Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to rewrite the Sortable.js library from scratch using modern TypeScript,
contemporary JavaScript patterns, and updated tooling. The goal is to create a more maintainable, performant, and
developer-friendly drag-and-drop library while preserving API compatibility and existing functionality.

## Decisions from stakeholder interview

The following decisions were made during a short stakeholder interview and are reflected in the roadmap and immediate
work items below:

- Forking and repo strategy: this will be a new fork and a different project — the code here will not maintain the
  original v1.x branch. The new project will be private until the first alpha release is ready.
- Project name (provisional): "Resortable" (used internally while the project is private).
- API compatibility: breaking changes are allowed but must be documented; where behavior changes are required we will
  map existing v1.x functionality to the new APIs and provide migration documentation and adapters where practical.
- Maintenance: there will be no long-lived v1 maintenance branch in this repo; v1.x will be treated as an external
  legacy project.
- Alpha scope: target a full-features alpha (Multi-drag, AutoScroll, Swap, animations, and plugin compatibility) plus
  tests to validate parity — i.e., the plan's "C" option.
- Tooling: use Vite for development / examples and Rollup for producing production library bundles (Vite dev + Rollup
  bundling — plan's "A" option).
- TypeScript policy: pragmatic strategy — enable strict mode ("strict": true) to get strong type guarantees, but allow
  targeted uses of `any` or brief `@ts-expect-error`/ignores in migration hotspots and legacy adapter shims to speed
  progress; the plan is to progressively tighten types over time.
- Publishing: keep the fork private until a v1-alpha release exists; publish name will be decided before public release
  ("Resortable" is provisional).

These decisions are authoritative for the next steps in the roadmap and small-PR plan described later in this document.

## Deprecated patterns & replacements

This focused list calls out specific antiquated or brittle patterns found in the v1 codebase and prescribes modern
replacements we will implement during the rewrite. Each item includes a short replacement approach and the phase where
it should be handled.

- Global module-scoped mutable variables (e.g. dragEl, parentEl, ghostEl): replace with instance-scoped state and a
  small StateManager (immutable update pattern or controlled mutators). Use a WeakMap<Element, Instance> for
  element→instance mapping. (Phase 1–2)

- DOM expando usage (el[expando] = instance): remove and use WeakMap to avoid DOM pollution and memory leaks; only use
  data-\* attributes for public IDs. (Phase 1)

- Monolithic files and circular dependencies (Sortable.js ↔ Animation.js ↔ utils.js): split into focused modules
  (core, DragManager, AnimationManager, utils/dom/geometry) and invert dependencies so animation code receives state
  rather than importing Sortable. (Phase 1–2)

- Browser UA sniffing (IE11OrLess, Edge, Safari, etc.): replace with feature detection (pointer events, CSS.supports)
  and capability gates; document dropped legacy browser support. (Phase 1)

- Ad‑hoc event system and pluginEvent patterns: replace with a typed EventSystem / EventEmitter and well-defined plugin
  lifecycle hooks; rely on CustomEvent for DOM-level events. (Phase 2)

- setTimeout-based animation coordination: adopt FLIP + requestAnimationFrame and CSS transitions, centralize animation
  orchestration in AnimationManager, remove brittle timeout choreography. (Phase 3)

- Low-level DOM utility duplication and fragile measurement logic: consolidate into typed `utils/dom.ts` and
  `utils/geometry.ts`, add unit tests for geometry helpers (getRect, matrix handling). (Phase 2)

- Manual style string concatenation & prefix hacks: centralize styles and prefer class toggles + CSS transitions; use
  CSS.supports and normalize prefixed behavior in a small helper. (Phase 2–3)

- Inconsistent event listener cleanup: provide unified add/remove helpers that return unregister functions and ensure
  `destroy()` cleans up listeners. (Phase 1)

- Legacy-heavy codepaths for older DnD APIs: isolate fallbacks behind adapters and make pointer events the primary path.
  (Phase 2)

Each of the above will be tracked as an explicit task in Phase 1–3 so replacements are tested and documented, and so
plugin authors have clear migration guidance.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths

- Well-established library with strong adoption (2.8M+ weekly downloads)
- Comprehensive feature set including multi-drag, auto-scroll, and plugin system
- Good browser compatibility
- Active community and ecosystem integrations

### Technical Debt & Issues

- **Monolithic Architecture**: 51KB single Sortable.js file with mixed concerns
- **Circular Dependencies**: Core modules have circular references (Sortable.js ↔ Animation.js ↔ utils.js)
- **Legacy Code**: Extensive IE9+ compatibility code mixed with modern features
- **No TypeScript**: Lack of type safety and modern development experience
- **Deprecated Tooling**: Uses outdated build tools (rollup-plugin-babel@4, etc.)
- **Global State**: Heavy reliance on global variables and mutable state
- **Testing Gaps**: Limited test coverage for edge cases
- **Performance Issues**: Inefficient DOM queries and event handling patterns

### Current Architecture Problems

```
Current Structure:
├── src/
│   ├── Sortable.js (51KB monolith)    // ⚠️ Too large, mixed concerns
│   ├── Animation.js                    // ⚠️ Circular dependency
│   ├── utils.js                        // ⚠️ Circular dependency
│   ├── BrowserInfo.js                  // ⚠️ Legacy browser detection
│   ├── EventDispatcher.js              // ⚠️ Simple event system
│   └── PluginManager.js                // ⚠️ Basic plugin architecture
```

## Goals & Principles

### Primary Goals

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type definitions
2. **Modern Architecture**: Class-based design with clear separation of concerns
3. **Performance**: Optimized DOM operations and memory usage
4. **Maintainability**: Modular, testable, and well-documented code
5. **Developer Experience**: Better APIs, debugging tools, and error messages
6. **Compatibility**: Maintain API compatibility while allowing modern usage patterns

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable patterns where possible
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Use composition for plugin architecture
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Modern features with graceful degradation
- **Easy Migration**: Provide clear migration paths and documentation for users upgrading from v1.x

```

### Class-Based Core Design

```typescript
// Core Sortable class
export class Sortable {
  private dragManager: DragManager
  private dropZone: DropZone
  private animationManager: AnimationManager
  private eventSystem: EventSystem
  private pluginSystem: PluginSystem

  constructor(element: Element, options: SortableOptions) {
    // Initialize subsystems
  }

  // Public API methods
  public destroy(): void
  public toArray(): string[]
  public sort(order: string[]): void
  // ... other methods
}

// Plugin system interface
export interface SortablePlugin {
  name: string
  version: string
  install(sortable: Sortable): void
  uninstall(sortable: Sortable): void
}
```

### State Management Strategy

```typescript
// Immutable state management
interface SortableState {
  readonly dragElement: Element | null
  readonly dropZones: ReadonlyArray<DropZone>
  readonly activeOperations: ReadonlyArray<DragOperation>
  readonly animationQueue: ReadonlyArray<Animation>
}

class StateManager {
  private state: SortableState

  public updateState(updater: (state: SortableState) => SortableState): void {
    this.state = Object.freeze(updater(this.state))
    this.notifySubscribers(this.state)
  }
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Establish TypeScript foundation and build system

#### Tasks:

- [x] Set up modern build toolchain (Vite/Rollup + TypeScript)
- [x] Create project structure and TypeScript configuration
- [x] Implement core types and interfaces
- [x] Set up testing framework (Vitest + Playwright)
- [x] Create basic Sortable class shell
- [x] Establish CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Set up documentation system (TypeDoc + JSDoc)
- [x] Configure semantic release automation
- [x] Set up code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TSDoc validation)

#### Deliverables: ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ TypeScript project structure with strict mode enabled
- ✅ Build system producing CommonJS, ESM, and UMD outputs
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e)
- ✅ TypeDoc documentation framework with GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with cross-platform testing
- ✅ Semantic release automation with conventional commits
- ✅ VS Code integration with IntelliSense and format-on-save

Notes and constraints for Phase 1

- This work will be performed in a new, private forked repository (provisional name: `Resortable`). The original v1.x
  project will not be maintained here.
- Tooling choice: Vite will be used for developer experience (dev server, examples, docs preview) and Rollup will be
  used for producing final library bundles (CJS/ESM/UMD). This allows fast iteration during development while retaining
  deterministic library outputs.
- TypeScript policy: start with `strict: true` to get strong type safety, but adopt a pragmatic migration policy
  allowing targeted `any` or `@ts-expect-error` during initial conversions; progressively remove those as modules are
  hardened.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 4-8) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Implement core drag-and-drop functionality

#### Tasks:

- [x] Implement DragManager class with HTML5 drag API
- [x] Create DropZone management system
- [x] Build EventSystem with proper TypeScript events
- [x] Implement basic sorting algorithms and DOM operations
- [x] Add DOM utilities with modern APIs
- [x] Create performance monitoring utilities
- [x] Implement GlobalDragState for cross-zone operations
- [x] Unit tests for core functionality (Vitest + jsdom)
- [x] E2E tests for drag-and-drop interactions (Playwright - 52/55 passing)
- [x] Documentation for core API and functionality

#### Plural-first drag model (added)

- Adopt a plural-first drag model across core APIs to support multi-drag natively.
  - Global active drag context stores `items: HTMLElement[]` rather than a single element.
  - Events already expose `items: HTMLElement[]`; `item` remains the primary/anchor.
  - Drop operations assume all dragged items land in the same `DropZone` at the same index.
  - `DropZone.move(items: HTMLElement[], toIndex: number)` inserts items in-order at the computed index, excluding the
    dragged items from the target’s current children to avoid index shifts.
  - Within-list reorders emit `update` continuously; cross-list moves emit `remove` (origin), `add` (destination), and
    `end` (origin), with `oldIndex/newIndex` referring to the primary item.

Rationale: Makes multi-drag a first-class concern and avoids retrofitting single-item code paths later. The assumption
that all dragged items go to the same place simplifies index math and DOM ops and mirrors Sortable v1’s MultiDrag
behavior.

#### Deliverables: ✅ COMPLETED

  - [x] Add `dragoverBubble` option (property initialized)
  - [x] Implement `removeCloneOnHide` option (property initialized)
  - [x] Add `emptyInsertThreshold` for empty list handling (property initialized)
  - [x] Add `preventOnFilter` option (fully implemented)

#### Deliverables:

- ✅ Complete swap behavior system with thresholds
- ✅ Automatic and manual direction detection
- ⏳ Full fallback system for legacy browser support
- ✅ Core v1.x event callbacks (onChoose, onSort, onChange, onMove)
- ⏳ Data management and persistence features
- ⏳ Visual customization options
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for completed features

#### Implementation Notes (December 2024):

**Completed Features:**
1. **Swap Threshold System**: Implemented opt-in swap threshold logic that defaults to undefined for backward compatibility. When set, calculates overlap percentage based on direction (vertical/horizontal) and respects invertSwap and invertedSwapThreshold options.

2. **Event Callbacks**: Added onChoose, onSort, onChange, and onMove callbacks with proper event data. Created MoveEvent interface with detailed position information (draggedRect, targetRect, relatedRect).

3. **Direction Detection**: Supports both automatic detection and manual override through the `direction` option.

**Key Learnings:**
- **Backward Compatibility**: Made swap threshold undefined by default rather than defaulting to 1.0, ensuring existing behavior isn't changed unless explicitly configured.
- **Test Challenges**: E2E tests for swap behavior and events require proper CSS positioning for getBoundingClientRect to work correctly. Tests are currently skipped with detailed TODO comments.
- **TypeScript in Tests**: Required extensive ESLint disable comments and type assertions in test files. Created `types.d.ts` for Window interface extensions.

#### Phase 2.5 Final Status (December 2024):

**Completed in Latest PR #12:**
1. **Event Callbacks**: Added onUnchoose callback and prepared onClone hook
2. **Data Management**: Implemented customizable dataIdAttr for toArray() method
3. **Visual Options**: Added all visual customization properties to configuration
4. **preventOnFilter**: Fully implemented with preventDefault() control
5. **Fallback Structure**: All fallback properties in place, ready for future implementation

**Deferred to Future Phases:**
- Full fallback system implementation (complex clone-based dragging)
- setData method for DataTransfer customization (Phase 5)
- Store functionality for persistence (Phase 5)

## Performance Targets

### Metrics

| Metric                    | Current | Target    | Improvement   |
| ------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Bundle Size (gzipped)     | ~30KB   | <25KB     | 17% reduction |
| Initial Sort (1000 items) | ~50ms   | <30ms     | 40% faster    |
| Animation Frame Rate      | ~45fps  | 60fps     | 33% smoother  |
| Memory Usage              | High    | Reduced   | 50% less      |
| Tree Shaking              | Poor    | Excellent | Plugin-based  |

### Optimization Strategies

- Use modern DOM APIs (Intersection Observer, ResizeObserver)
- Implement efficient diffing algorithms
- Optimize event listener management
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

## Breaking Changes & Migration

### Non-Breaking Changes

- All existing APIs remain functional (except for those where we have dropped functionality)
- Same event names and signatures
- Same initialization patterns
- Same plugin interfaces

### Breaking Changes

- Drop IE support
- Drop support for all browsers over 2 years old
- Pull MultiDrag and Swap plugins into core and remove duplicated functionality where unnecessary
- Take a MultiDrag-first approach to selection and dragging. Single-item drag can be simply treated as a multi-item drag
  with one item.
- In general, take a multi-item approach when there's any question that single-item activities might have need for
  multi-item capability in the future.
- Use modern event handling patterns (e.g., Promises, async/await)
- We will break existing APIs when support for newer, more flexible functionality would create redundancy.

### New TypeScript APIs

```typescript
// Enhanced type-safe initialization
const sortable = new Sortable(element, {
  group: 'shared',
  animation: 150,
  onEnd: (event: SortableEvent) => {
    // event is fully typed
  },
})

// Plugin installation with types
sortable.use(AutoScrollPlugin, {
  speed: 10,
  sensitivity: 10,
})
```

### Migration Guide Outline

- Escape key provides universal cancel operation for better UX

#### 2. **Multi-Selection Architecture**

- SelectionManager provides centralized selection state management
- Visual feedback through customizable CSS classes (selectedClass, focusClass)
- Event-driven architecture ensures UI stays synchronized with selection state
- Supports both keyboard and mouse selection patterns seamlessly

#### 3. **ARIA Integration Strategy**

- Used semantic roles (listbox/option) for proper screen reader interpretation
- Dynamic aria-selected and aria-grabbed attributes track interaction state
- Live region announcements provide real-time feedback for all operations
- Proper tabindex management ensures keyboard navigability

#### 4. **Testing Accessibility**

- Created 9 comprehensive E2E tests covering all accessibility features
- Tests validate keyboard navigation, multi-selection, and screen reader support
